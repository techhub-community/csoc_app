//todo: auth 4) import built_value package and learn about it if u don't know


/*built_value is a Dart package that provides code generation
 for reducing boilerplate code when we need to create Value Types.
 more information here: https://github.com/google/built_value.dart
 */

// Value object are defined by their attributes rather than its identity.
//eg. abstract class Email{}
//todo:auth - ensure that the email format is validated before an object is instantiated.


// Entities tend to represent more complex objects or concepts in
// your domain, while value objects are used to encapsulate simpler,
// more atomic concepts or measures. Both play important roles
// in creating a rich, expressive domain model.
